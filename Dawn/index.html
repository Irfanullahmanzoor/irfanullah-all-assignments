                    <strong>The United States announced on Friday it was <a href="">revoking the designation</a> of
                        Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a
                        terrorist group effective February 16, a reversal by the Biden administration which was welcomed
                        by
                        the
                        United Nations and humanitarian groups who feared former president Donald Trump’s actions would
                        impede
                        aid deliveries to the conflict-torn country facing the world’s worst humanitarian
                        crisis.</strong> <br><br>

                    US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s decision to rescind the
                    designation “a recognition
                    of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen”. He said the new US administration listened to warnings
                    from the United Nations, humanitarian groups, bipartisan members of Congress and others “that the
                    designations could have a devastating impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities like food and
                    fuel”. <br>

                    Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through commercial channels, and UN
                    humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last month that the US designation of the Houthis already had
                    companies pulling back from dealing with the Yemenis and would likely lead to “a large-scale famine
                    on a
                    scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years”. <br>

                    Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN Secretary-General Antonio
                    Guterres, where Yemen was one of the issues they discussed. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday
                    called the US action “extremely positive”. “We hope that helps build momentum for a political
                    solution
                    to the conflict in Yemen,” Dujarric said. “I think the reversal of the designation, the naming of
                    the
                    [US] special envoy [for Yemen], and the clear, clear language from the top of the administration,
                    from
                    president Biden himself, expressing his strong support for the UN-led mediation process [...] are
                    very,
                    very welcome indeed.” <br>

                    In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s north, driving the
                    government
                    into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened the following year to try and restore the
                    internationally recognised government, but years of UN efforts to get both sides to agree to a
                    ceasefire
                    and start peace negotiations have not succeeded. The conflict has been disastrous for Yemen, the
                    Arab
                    world’s poorest country, killing more than 112,000 people, creating a humanitarian disaster, and
                    wrecking infrastructure from roads and hospitals to water and electricity networks. <br>

                    The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was moving to revoke the designation, a day
                    after
                    the president announced an end to offensive support to Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthis.
